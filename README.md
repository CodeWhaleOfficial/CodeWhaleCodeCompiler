This was originally a part of CodeWhale's project. but the module became very large, so I
separated it into this repository. This is currently in WIP (Work-In-Progress).

Therefore, I will not make any maintenance at the moment. **Use the code at your own risk**.

## Notes

Kotlin + Jetpack compose examples see `app`, Java examples see `app2`.

## Disclaimer
The library is originally built for PERSONAL PURPOSES, which I was migrating into a standalone repository for a clear work environment to continue to work for this.

The library WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED VERY SOON. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE INSPECT THE IMPLEMENTATION CODE AND BUILD IT BY YOURSELF.

Meanwhile, the library is NOT LIMITED by any companies or cooperation.

The more README updates, the publish time postpones.
