This was originally a part of CodeWhale's project by CodeWhaleStudio. but the module became very large, so I
separated it into this repository. This is currently in WIP (Work-In-Progress).

Therefore, I will not make any maintenance at the moment. **Use the code at your own risk**.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/CodeWhaleStudio/CodeWhaleCodeTools-WIP-/wiki) for guides.
