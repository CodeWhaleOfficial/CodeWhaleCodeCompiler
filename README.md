This was originally a part of CodeWhale's project by CodeWhaleStudio. but the module became very large, so I
separated it into this repository. This is currently WIP (Work-In-Progress).

Therefore, I will not make any maintenance at the moment. **Use the code at your own risk**.

Currently, the library is published with commit snapshot which is available in JitPack, as I personally reckon that this library has a bug improvement and will be changed regularly, which I don't decide to publish a version release at the moment.

Below are the tools that will be used for and based on CodeWhale's need, but you can also use it, This is a library. The library is based on the developers who **are using sora-editor, developing in Kotlin**.
